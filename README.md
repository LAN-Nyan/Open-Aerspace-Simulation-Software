**Open Aerspace Sim**
Beginner-Friendly Aerodynamic Simulation Software

Open Aerspace Sim is an intuitive aerodynamic and structural simulation tool designed for hobbyists and beginners. The software streamlines the process of simulating aerospace designs and reviewing results, making advanced concepts accessible to everyone.

**Note: Open Aerspace Sim is currently in active development. The first BETA release is scheduled for 10/31/25.**

Features


**Aerodynamics Simulation**

Run aerodynamic calculations using either default (standard) or advanced modes.
Input your own data or use preset configurations for quick results.



**Structural Integrity Calculation**

Import and analyze 3D files to assess structural strength.
Use the innovative brush tool to "paint" regions of material density (e.g., kg/cmÂ³) and integrity directly on your model.



**Inlet & Output Management**

Easily mark and define air intakes and exhausts.
Configure properties for each inlet/output for more accurate simulations.



**Getting Started**

* Import your aerospace design as a 3D file.
* Configure aerodynamic and structural analysis settings as desired.
* Use the brush tool to define material properties and highlight critical zones.
* Mark any intakes and outputs, providing details for simulation.
* Run simulations and review the results with the user-friendly analysis tools.

**Roadmap**

* Improved support for additional 3D file formats **11/30/25**
* Expanded simulation accuracy and visualization **12/31/25**
* More advanced customization for the brush tool and result analysis **01/31/26**


Open Aerspace Sim aims to make aerospace simulation accessible to everyone. Stay tuned for the upcoming BETA 0.01 release on **10/31/25!**

**Updates to the software release once every month, which include new features, bug fixes, etc.**
