Open Aerspace Sim: The Aerodynamic Simulation Software for Beginners

Open Aerspace Sim is an intuitive tool designed for hobbyists who want to explore aerospace simulation without the complexity of professional-grade software. Its main goals are to simplify the simulation process and provide easy review of results.

Key Features

* Aerodynamics Simulation:
  * Perform aerodynamic calculations using either default (standard) or advanced modes based on user-provided data.
* Structural Integrity Calculation:
  * Supports only 3D files.
  * Includes a unique brush tool that lets users “paint” regions of strength and integrity directly onto their model. For example, you can specify material density (kg/cm³) and highlight specific areas for analysis.
* Inlet and Output Management:
  * Easily mark and configure intakes and exhausts on your model. While detailed airflow simulation is limited to inlet and output specification, you have control over the placement and properties.

Open Aerspace Sim is ideal for beginners and hobbyists seeking a user-friendly entry point into aerodynamic and structural analysis for aerospace projects.
